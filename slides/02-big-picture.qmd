# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility checklist

::: question
What does it mean for an analysis to be reproducible?
:::

. . .

**Near term goals**:

✔️ Can the tables and figures be exactly reproduced from the code and data?

✔️ Does the code actually do what you think it does?

✔️ In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long term goals**:

✔️ Can the code be used for other data?

✔️ Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Why is reproducibility important?

-   Results produced are more reliable and trustworthy [@ostblom2022]

-   Facilitates more effective collaboration [@ostblom2022]

-   Contributing to science, which builds and organizes knowledge in terms of testable hypotheses [@alexander2023]

-   Possible to identify and correct errors or biases in the analysis process [@alexander2023]

## Why is reproducibility important? {.midi}

<div>

-   Originally reported "the intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in a fewer number of mean COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits at 6 months per participant."

-   There were actually **more** COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the intervention group compared to the control group

-   Mixed up the intervention vs. control group using "0/1" coding

## Toolkit

-   **Scriptability** $\rightarrow$ R

-   **Literate programming** (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto

-   **Version control** $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## R and RStudio

-   R is a statistical programming language

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

![Source: [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html)](images/02/r_vs_rstudio_1.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RStudio IDE

![](images/02/rstudio-panes.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quarto

-   Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render

-   Code goes in chunks and narrative goes outside of chunks

-   Visual editor to make document editing experience similar to a word processor (Google docs, Word, Pages, etc.)

## Quarto

![](images/02/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise and assignment is written in a Quarto document

-   You'll have a template Quarto document to start with

-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

## git and GitHub

![](images/02/git-github.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **git** is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word.
-   **GitHub** is the home for your git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
-   There are a lot of git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

# Multivariable relationships

## Education and life expectancy

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(readxl)

life_exp <- read_excel("data/life-expectancy-data.xlsx") |> 
  rename(life_exp = `Life_expectancy_at_birth`, 
         income_inequality = `Income_inequality_Gini_coefficient`) |>
  mutate(education = if_else(Education_Index > median(Education_Index), "High", "Low"), 
         education = factor(education, levels = c("Low", "High")))
```

The data set comes from @zarulli2021 who analyze the effects of a country's healthcare expenditures and other factors on the country's life expectancy. The data are originally from the [Human Development Database](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) and [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).

There are `r nrow(life_exp)` countries (observations) in the data set.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variable definitions

::: incremental
-   `life_exp`: *The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area.* ( from the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/65#:~:text=Definition%3A,%2C%20territory%2C%20or%20geographic%20area.))

-   `income_inequality`: *Measure of the deviation of the distribution of income among individuals or households within a country from a perfectly equal distribution. A value of 0 represents absolute equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality (Gini coefficient).*
:::

## Variable definitions

-   `education`: Indicator of whether a country's education index is above (`High`) or below (`Low`) the median index for the `r nrow(life_exp)` countries in the data set.
    -   Education index: *Average of mean years of schooling (of adults) and expected years of school (of children), both expressed as an index obtained by scaling wit the corresponding maxima.*

## Terminology

-   `life_exp` is the **response variable**
    -   variable whose variation we want to understand / variable we wish to predict
    -   also known as *outcome* or *dependent* variable

. . .

-   `income_inequality`, `education` are the **predictor variables**
    -   variables used to account for variation in the response
    -   also known as *explanatory*, *independent*, or *input* variables

## Univariate exploratory data analysis

```{r univariate}
#| echo: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = life_exp))  + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Life expectancy (in years)", 
       y = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = income_inequality))  + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Income inequality", 
       y = "Count") 

p3 <- ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = education))  + 
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Education index", 
       y = "Count")

p1 + (p2 / p3)
```

## Bivariate exploratory data analysis

```{r bivariate}
#| echo: false
p1 <- ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = income_inequality, y = life_exp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Income inequality", 
      y  = "Life expectancy (in years)")

p2 <- ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = education, y = life_exp)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Education index", 
      y  = "Life expectancy (in years)")
  
p1 + p2
```

## Function between response and predictors

::: goal
$$\text{life_exp} = f(\text{income_inequality}, \text{education}) + \epsilon$$
:::

-   **Goal**: Determine $f$
-   How do we determine $f$?
    -   Make an assumption about the functional form $f$ (parametric model)
    -   Use the data to fit a model based on that form

## Determine $f$

1)  Choose the functional form of $f$, i.e., **choose the appropriate model given the response variable**

-   Suppose $f$ takes the form of a linear model\
    $$y = f(\mathbf{X}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon$$

. . .

2.  Use the data to fit (or train) the model, i.e, **compute estimates of the model parameters**, denoted $\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \ldots, \hat{\beta}_p$

## `life_exp` vs. `income_inequality`

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = income_inequality, y = life_exp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Income inequality", 
      y  = "Life expectancy (in years))", 
      title = "Life expectancy vs. income inequality")
```

$$\widehat{\text{life_exp}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 ~\text{income_inequality}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `life_exp` vs. `income_inequality` + `education` {.midi}

```{r echo = F}
model1 <- lm(life_exp ~ income_inequality + education, data = life_exp)
model1 <- tidy(model1)
```

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = income_inequality, y = life_exp, color = education, shape = education)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = model1$estimate[2], intercept = model1$estimate[1], color = "#440154FF", size = 1.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = model1$estimate[2], intercept = model1$estimate[1] + model1$estimate[3], color = "#29AF7FFF", size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Income inequality", 
      y  = "Life expectancy (in years)",
      color = "Education", 
      shape = "Education",
      title = "Life expectancy vs. income inequality", 
      subtitle = "by education") + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#440154FF", "#29AF7FFF"))
```

$$\widehat{\text{life_exp}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 ~\text{income_inequality} + \hat{\beta}_2 ~\text{education}$$

## Statistical model vs. regression equation {.midi}

**Statistical model (also known as the data-generating model)**

::: equation
$${\small \text{life_exp} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ~\text{income_inequality} + \beta_2 ~\text{education} + \epsilon}$$
:::

Models the process for generating values of the response in the population (function + error), i.e., the [population-level]{.underline} model.

<br>

. . .

**Regression equation (also known as the fitted model)**

Estimate of the function using the sample data

::: equation
$${\small \widehat{\text{life_exp}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 ~\text{income_inequality} + \hat{\beta}_2 ~\text{education}}$$
:::

## `life_exp` vs. `income_inequality` + `education` (with interaction) {.midi}

```{r}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = life_exp, aes(x = income_inequality, y = life_exp, color = education, shape = education)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Income inequality", 
      y  = "Life expectancy (in years)",
      color = "Education", 
      shape = "Education",
      title = "Life expectancy vs. income inequality", 
      subtitle = "by education (with interaction)") + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#440154FF", "#29AF7FFF"))

```

$${\small \widehat{\text{life_exp}} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 ~\text{income_inequality} + \hat{\beta}_2 ~\text{education} + \hat{\beta}_3 ~ \text{income_inequality} \times \text{education}}$$

## Why fit a model?

-   **Prediction:** Expected value of the response variable for given values of the predictor variables

-   **Inference:** Conclusion about the relationship between the response and predictor variables

. . .

::: question
-   What is an example of a **prediction** question that can be answered using the model of `life_exp` vs. `income_inequality` and `education`?

-   What is an example of an **inference** question that can be answered using the model of `life_exp` vs.`income_inequality` and `education`?

## Recap {.midi}

-   **Reproducibility**

    -   It is best practice conduct all data analysis in a reproducible way

    -   We will implement a reproducible workflow using R, Quarto, and git/GitHub

<!-- -->

-   **Multivariable relationships**

    -   We can use exploratory data analysis to describe the relationship between two variables

    -   We make an assumption about the relationship between variables when doing linear regression

    -   The two main objectives for fitting a linear regression model are (1) prediction and (2) inference
